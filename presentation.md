Project Name and Objective
 - Fantasy Football Stat Tracker
 - Objective is to have an easy, personalized way to view player stats


Demonstration
- So the main thing I wanted from this project is something that is updated whenever I access it. 
- Making it a web page vs a spreadsheet

MVP's were
- View player data for the current season
I got names so far

- Be able to search specific players
shouldn't be too hard

- sort players by stats
soon

- pick a handful of players to watch and see their trends
soon


Process
- Apis not working (yahoo basicallly)

- R stuff not working after a bunch of R work

- Taking forever to get a web scraper to work

Challenges

nothing worked for almost the entire time
